# LibraryInventoryTool
A MySQL Database with a C# user interface application for maintaining a library of books.

I have over 1500 science fiction books as well as hundreds of other books. I've decided to create a tool to hellp me keep track
of the books I own and the books I want to buy or sell.

So far the repository only contains the SQL file to create the database and 48 stored procedures and functions.

When completed this repository will containt the SQL to create the database and all the stored procedures as well as
a C# application using MVC architecture to add, delete and update books and authors.
